Certainly! Hereâ€™s a description of typical `.sh` files you might find in a dockerized project like yours:

**Note:**  
Actual scripts may vary depending on your repo. You can view and edit them in the project root or backend folder. Each script should be made executable with `chmod +x scriptname.sh`.

If you have specific `.sh` files in your repo, let me know their names or contents for more tailored documentation!
